**We can filter doctors data by  City, slot time,Consultation Date**
This project aims to facilitate users in finding available slots for appointments based on city, time, and date inputs. Upon entering a city name, the system instantly filters the data to display relevant information. However, to check slot availability, users need to provide specific time and date information.

**Usage Instructions**

**City Filtering:**

Enter the desired city name in the designated input field. The system will dynamically filter and display relevant data accordingly.
**Checking Slot Availability:**

Time Format: Use the "hh:mm" format (e.g., "09:30") to specify the desired time.
Date Format: Use the "dd-mm-yyyy" format (e.g., "06-02-2024") to specify the desired date.
Click the "Submit" button after entering the time and date details.
**Example:**

Suppose you're looking for available slots in Delhi City:

Enter "Delhi" in the city input field.
Specify the desired time as "09:30" and the date as "06-02-2024".
Click the "Submit" button to check for available slots.
At this time in data base only three city data is available
**Delhi,Pune,Kolkata.**
